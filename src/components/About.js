        The project draws inspiration from Italo Calvino’s book “The Invisible
        Cities” to create an interdisciplinary performance of music and theatre
        that aims to take the audience on a journey through hidden threads of
        cities we live in and forgotten spaces that live inside us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance is built around musical scenes. Three musicians will
        create a “musical architecture”, translating essence of cities into
        music. An adventurous Marco Polo, in a metaphorical dialogue with the
        musicians, will guide the audience through the message of these cities.

        The novel "The Invisible Cities" is an imaginary account that the famous
        Venetian traveler Marco Polo makes to the emperor of the Tartars, Kublai
        Kahn, about the cities spread over the immense territory of his Empire.
        At the boundary between reality and imagination, these accounts become a
        representation of life experiences, human emotions, desires, fears
        memories and relationships hidden under the appearance of cities.

        In the dialogue with emperor Kublai Kahn, Marco Polo uses often a
        chessboard, symbols and gestures to describe the cities that he visited.
        We also aim to create a metaphoric dialogue between musical and
        theatrical signs and languages, exploring the intersections between the
        two performing arts.
