        The project draws inspiration from Italo Calvino’s book “The Invisible
        Cities” to create an interdisciplinary performance of music and theatre
        that aims to take the audience on a journey through hidden threads of
        cities we live in and forgotten spaces that live inside us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novel "The Invisible Cities" is an imaginary account that the famous
        Venetian traveler Marco Polo makes to the emperor of the Tartars, Kublai
        Kahn, about the cities spread over the immense territory of his Empire.
        At the boundary between reality and imagination, these accounts become a
        representation of life experiences, human emotions, desires, fears
        memories and relationships hidden under the appearance of cities.

        In the dialogue with emperor Kublai Kahn, Marco Polo uses often a
        chessboard, symbols and gestures to describe the cities that he visited.
        We also aim to create a metaphoric dialogue between musical and
        theatrical signs and languages, exploring the intersections between the
        two performing arts.{" "}

        The performance is built around musical scenes. Three musicians will
        create a “musical architecture”, translating essence of cities into
        music. An adventurous Marco Polo, in a metaphorical dialogue with the
        musicians, will guide the audience through the message of these cities.

        Born out of a desire of bringing chamber music to new artistic contexts,
        the performance connects music, theatre, literature and, in the
        performance organised in collaboration with the Estorick Collection
        during their exhibition ‘Counterpoint', sculpture. There is a
        significant artistic connection between writer Italo Calvino and
        sculptor abstractionist Fausto Melotti. Calvino often said that, after
        seeing Melotti’s sculptures, he had to write about cities as thin as his
        sculptures: ‘cities on stilts, spiderweb cities’. Calvino praised
        Melotti as ‘an acrobat of the invisible’, admiring qualities of
        lightness, accuracy, multiplicity of his work. The performance will
        bring the two artists together, giving sound to their incredibly
        insightful and imaginative expression of reality.{" "}

      <p>some cities we drew inspiration from: Cities and Signs – Ipazia</p>
      <p>
        “Of all the translations a traveler goes through in far away lands, none
        are equal to that, which expects him in Ipazia, since here not words but
        things become translated.”
